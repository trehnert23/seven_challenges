## Seven Challenges

This lab is designed to review topics we've learned in the past weeks, including: jquery, forms, ajax, and express routing.

Each challenge is located at its own endpoint and has instructions in its own `challenge.js` file. Take care that you're looking at the correct file!

### To get started
``` bash
git clone THIS_REPO
cd seven_challenges
subl .
npm install
nodemon # or node index.js
```

Then:
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/challenges/` for the list of challenges.
- See `/challenges/1/challenge.js` for challenge #1 instructions.
